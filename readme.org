* Basic load cell resistance checks
| Resistance check | Typical 350 Ω |
|------------------+---------------|
| Ex+ to Ex-       | ~410Ω         |
| S+ to S-         | 350Ω          |
| Ex+ to S+        | ~315Ω         |
| Ex+ to S-        | ~315Ω         |
| Ex- to S+        | ~280Ω         |
| Ex- to S-        | ~280Ω         |
